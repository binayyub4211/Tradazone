## 🛠️ Developer Guide: Auth & SignUp

Tradazone uses a multi-chain, wallet-based authentication system. This guide explains how to modify the sign-up and authentication flows.

### Authentication Flow Overview
Authentication is managed globally via the `AuthContext` (`src/context/AuthContext.jsx`). It handles:
- **Session Persistence**: Saving and loading user sessions from `localStorage`.
- **Wallet Integration**: Connecting to Stellar (LOBSTR), Starknet (Argent/Braavos), and EVM wallets (MetaMask, etc.).
- **Automatic Login**: Detecting existing wallet connections on page load.

### Modifying the SignUp Page
The `SignUp` page (`src/pages/auth/SignUp.jsx`) is the entry point for new users. It uses the `ConnectWalletModal` to handle the actual wallet connection.

To modify the post-connection logic, look at the `handleConnectSuccess` function:
```javascript
const handleConnectSuccess = () => {
    // Mark as first-time user to trigger WelcomeModal onboarding
    localStorage.setItem('tradazone_onboarded', 'false');
    navigate(redirectTo, { replace: true });
};
```

### Adding New Wallet Providers
To add support for a new wallet or chain:
1.  **Update `AuthContext.jsx`**: Add a new connection method (e.g., `connectSolanaWallet`) and integrate it into the `connectWallet` dispatcher.
2.  **Update `ConnectWalletModal.jsx`**: Add a new button for the provider and call your new connection method.
3.  **Wallet Discovery**: If the provider supports EIP-6963, it may already be partially detected by `src/utils/wallet-discovery.js`.

### Onboarding & Welcome Logic
When a user connects for the first time, we set `tradazone_onboarded` to `false`. This triggers the `WelcomeModal` (`src/components/ui/WelcomeModal.jsx`) on the Dashboard.
- **Resetting Onboarding**: To test the onboarding flow again, clear your local storage or run `localStorage.removeItem('tradazone_onboarded')` in the console.

### Deep Linking & Redirects
The `SignUp` page supports a `redirect` search parameter. This is useful for sending users back to a specific invoice or checkout page after they've authenticated:
`https://tradazone.com/signup?redirect=/invoices/INV-001`
